o Many of the stats reported (i.e. calibration data) do not make sense and
  need to be verified.  This are non-critical stat but still important

o All of the timers should be ensured/calibrated

o STENCIL: 
        - The calibration step only considers local computation and ignores
          the communication step.  This is wrong and the considerable 
          communication step should be considered.
